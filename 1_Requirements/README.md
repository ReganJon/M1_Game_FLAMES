## Research
Though it is unknown who invented the game, we can assume that the game was created around the 90’s, that’s a really really long time ago. And it was played among kids and teenagers. It kills some boredom during our leisure time and makes us enjoy.
The main aim of the flames calculator is to make easy to play the game. If any one wants to play the flames game manually first they need to identify and cancel the same letters in both the names and then need to count the left over letters and need to cancel the word FLAMES untill one letter remains this is how manually peoples play the flames game but with the help of this code the whole process made easy by just enetering two names it gives the realtion between those two people in fraction of seconds
there are many systems existing in online those will work through internet but this system will work in even offline

## Cost and Features and Timeline
### i) Without digital platform :
 - Needed pen and paper to play.
 - Its costs only includes the cost of the pen and the paper. 
 - Only man-power needed.
 - Can use any procedure to play.
### ii) With digital platform :
 - Any pair of inputs are taken at a time.
 - Shows flames result of those pairs.
 - Many different logics are designed in different sites to obtain many different results.
 - Mostly its free on internet and app stores.
## Defining Our System
It has some set of rules to play the game by writing the names of two person and striking out the repeated letters and counting the rest of the letters in that names. Followed by striking out each letter in word FLAMES using the number that had been counted. The final withstanding letter from FLAMES depicts the relation between that two person. 
Its not mandatory to use only the above logic instead we can make use of our own way of playing this game which should have a proper outcome.
