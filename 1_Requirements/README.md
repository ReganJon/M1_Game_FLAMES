## Introduction
### FLAMES GAME

FLAMES is a fun game named after the acronym: 
**F**riends, **L**overs, **A**ffectionate, **M**arriage, **E**nemies and **S**ister.
This game does not accurately predict whether or not an individual is right for you, but it can be fun to play this with your friends.
It can be played in many ways.

## Research

 ### 1) Who invented this game ?
Though it is unknown who invented the game, research I made shows that the game was created around the 90’s, that’s a really really long time ago. And… it was played among kids and teenagers.

### 2) How To Play The Game

The original version of FLAMES is played on a paper. So you will need a pen and paper.

-   **Write your name and your partner’s name on a piece of paper**
    On the piece of paper, you are to write your full name and your partner’s full name. Though this is not necessary, it is the best way to test your FLAMES. Also, don’t use nicknames.
    For example; we will use the names  _“Tony Stark”_  &  _“Pepper Stark”_
-   **Cancel out the common letters in both names**
    Now, you are to cancel out the common letters in both of the names irrespective of the case in which the letters are written in. Note that, you are only to cancel out an instance of the letter in both names, not all instances of the letter.    
    We then get  _“Tony”_ Stark”  &  _“Pepper_ Stark”.    
-   **Count the number of remaining letters**    
    We then count the number of letters which were not cancelled in both names.    
    So we combine the un-cancelled letters and get  _“TonyPepper”_. We then count the number and get 10.    
-   **We then compare the number to the acronym FLAMES**
So we start assigning each number to each letter in the acronym, like 1 -> F, 2->L,3->A,… till we get to 10. If we get to the end of the acronym, we restart the counter till we get to ten. For example, 6 -> S so 7 will then start at F again till we get to the end of the number.
So the number 10, will end at M. We then compare the answer to this simple table below.

|Letter|Meaning   | 
|------|----------|
|F     |Friend    |
|L     |Love      |
|A     |Affection|
|M     |Marriage  |
|E     |Enemy     |
|S     |Sister    |
So, the relationship between  _“Tony Stark”_  and  _“Pepper Stark”_  is Marriage.
