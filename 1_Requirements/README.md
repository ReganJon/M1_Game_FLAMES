## Introduction
### FLAMES GAME

FLAMES is a fun game named after the acronym: 
**F**riends, **L**overs, **A**ffectionate, **M**arriage, **E**nemies and **S**ister.
This game does not accurately predict whether or not an individual is right for you, but it can be fun to play this with your friends.
It can be played in many ways.

## Research
Though it is unknown who invented the game, research I made shows that the game was created around the 90’s, that’s a really really long time ago. And it was played among kids and teenagers. It kills some boredom during our leisure time and makes us enjoy.
It has some set of rules to play the game by striking out the repeated letters and counting the rest of the letters in the names. Followed by striking out each letter in word FLAMES using the number that had been counted. The final withstanding letter from FLAMES is the actual result. 
Its not mandatory to use only the above logic instead we can make use of our own way of playing this game which should have a proper outcome.

## SWOT ANALYSIS
SWOT Analysis is a simple tool that can help you to analyze what your company does best right now, and to devise a successful strategy for the future. SWOT can also reveal areas of the business that are holding you back, or that your competitors could exploit if you don't protect yourself.

**a) Strengths :**

Strengths are things that my FLAMES game does particularly well, or in a way that distinguishes you from other competitors.

**b) Weaknesses :**

Weaknesses, like strengths, are inherent features of my projects, so focus on our people, resources, systems, and procedures.

**c) Opportunity :**

They usually arise from situations outside your organization, and require an eye to what might happen in the future and how can we improve it to entertain the the users excelling our competitors.

Threats include anything that can negatively affect my game from the outside.
